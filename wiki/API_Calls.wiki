#summary API calls to be made to radio reddit and reddit

= Introduction =

This document is to show how to make the API calls to radio reddit


= Getting Streams Information =

Make a call to http://radioreddit.com/config/streams.json to get a list of all the streams.

The json returns a List of Streams.

A Stream object consists of:
  * String Description
  * String Server (ip address.... not sure what used for)
  * String Transcoder (ip address... again not sure)
  * String Status (This is the path to other JSON calls, e.g. /api/electronic maps to http://radioreddit.com/api/electronic/status.json, etc.)
  * String Playlists (another directory mapping? Seems to be for playing in browser)
  * List of Relays (these are the addresses we stream from)

A Relay object consists of
  * String Server (address to stream from)

Stream information should be only called onCreate and should not need to be called again during lifecycle of the application
