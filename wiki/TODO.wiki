#summary Todo list

== Alpha ==

  * Use Android 3.0 fragments (push to beta?)
  * Media volume should change on change station activity
  * Add Flurry tracking
  * Add support for talk station (No official APIs yet)
  * Check for TODO's in code
  * Clean up code, add GPL licensing to each file
  * Headset controls support (play/stop? next/prev switch streams?)
  * (DONE Handle condition of being in preparing state when switching stations (currently throws illegal state)
  * (DONE) Change station needs to be a button click on a layout, not the text (it is currently hard to tap on)
  * (DONE) If removed head phones, stop media player
  * (DONE) Override volume control to media volume
  * (DONE) Wifi Wake lock
  * (DONE) UI state for buttons (hover, pressed, etc.)
  * (DONE) Update notification with current song info
  * (DONE) Fix state issues with playback control
    * (DONE) isAborting - user decides to change mind and wants to play again while still isPreparing.  Remove isAborting flag?
  * (DONE) Fix weird state issue with activity sometimes spawning new, which then doesn't use the correct application state so it resets displayed info to main stream (even if it is playing a different stream). Proposed fix: don't use app state in activity, get the information from the service (service should push info to whatever activity is showing) Actual fix: getStreams API call was overwriting the current stream value
  * (DONE) Add Email Feedback menu button
  * (DONE) Add an Exit menu button
      * (DONE) Exit still isn't working just quite right
  * (DONE) Fix wrapping issues with songs/artists/playlists that are too long
  * (DONE) More robust API calling
    * (DONE) Check if stream is online
    * (DONE) Check if radioreddit is down
    * (DONE) Check if reddit is down
    * (DECLINED) Check for 404s or other possible errors... - don't think this is necessary for just getting information, for other methods (login, vote), yes
  * (DECLINED) Check if stream has changed when getting current info - not really an issue; very, very rare and would be correct in 30 seconds anyways
  * (DONE) Move get streams to async task
    * (DONE) Have it called every 30 seconds
    * (DONE) Fix behavior of startup with this now being async
  * (DONE) Show buffering spinning please wait
