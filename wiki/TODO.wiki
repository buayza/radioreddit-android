      * https://github.com/Ramblurr/mp3tunes-android/blob/5588742d2b50a08bef686670d72c9770eac7a69c/src/com/mp3tunes/android/service/Mp3tunesService.java

      * Official last.fm client: https://github.com/c99koder/lastfm-android/blob/master/app/src/fm/last/android/player/RadioPlayerService.java
      * Stop worrying about onBuffering, focus on onCompletion (when it stops streaming) and whether to "re-try" the stream or not?
  * Add Flurry tracking
  * Check if stream has changed when getting current info
  * More robust API calling
    * Check if stream is online
    * (DONE) Check if radioreddit is down
    * (DONE) Check if reddit is down
    * Check for 404s or other possible errors...
  * Move get streams to async task
    * Have it called every so often (also 30 seconds? or longer? 5 minutes?)
    * Fix behavior of startup with this now being async
  * Lose connection to stream: attempt to replay, etc.?
  * Better landscape orientation
  * Add support for talk station (No official APIs yet)
  * Check for TODO's in code
  * Android 3.0 support (push to Beta?)
  * (DONE Handle condition of being in preparing state when switching stations (currently throws illegal state)
  * (DONE) Change station needs to be a button click on a layout, not the text (it is currently hard to tap on)
  * (DONE) If removed head phones, stop media player
  * (DONE) Override volume control to media volume
  * (DONE) Wifi Wake lock
  * (DONE) UI state for buttons (hover, pressed, etc.)
  * (DONE) Update notification with current song info
  * (DONE) Fix state issues with playback control
    * (DONE) isAborting - user decides to change mind and wants to play again while still isPreparing.  Remove isAborting flag?
  * (DONE) Fix weird state issue with activity sometimes spawning new, which then doesn't use the correct application state so it resets displayed info to main stream (even if it is playing a different stream). Proposed fix: don't use app state in activity, get the information from the service (service should push info to whatever activity is showing) Actual fix: getStreams API call was overwriting the current stream value

  * (DONE) Add an Exit menu button
